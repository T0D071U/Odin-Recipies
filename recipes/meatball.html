    <h2>Steps to make the world famous meatballs:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add Italian bread crumbs and milk. 
        Combine well and set aside while preparing the other ingredients, 
        for at least 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, egg, salt, black pepper, 
        parmesan cheese, and parsley to the breadcrumb mixture, and mix with your 
        hands until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Portion onto the prepared baking sheet (using a cookie or ice cream 
        scoop will make it easier). Wet your hands with water, and roll meatballs 
        into 2" diameter balls.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 18-20 minutes, or until the meatballs have reached an 
        internal temperature of 165˚F (74°C). Remove from oven and drain off any 
        excess fat. Serve with your favorite sauce and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
